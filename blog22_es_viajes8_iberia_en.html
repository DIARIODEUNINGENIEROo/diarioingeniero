                <em>February 25th to March 7th, 2022</em>  
                <h1>Day 1, Toledo to Cordoba</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_1_toledo-cordoba.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_1_toledo-cordoba"/><br>
					<p>The departure of the first day would have Córdoba as its destination. The arrival would be around 12 in the morning. Park near the Parque de la Victoria, right in the center of Córdoba. The historic center is to the southwest of the park, which is bounded by the Guadalquivir River to the south and by the convents to the north, the Christ of the lanterns, among others.
                    <br>
                    It is a city that existed before the Romans, possibly an Iberian town that grew due to trade with some Phoenician post. There are many Roman remains in the city and an archaeological museum, as the ruins of the old Roman theater still exist. But what stands out is the Mozarabic period in which one of the largest Islamic buildings, the Mosque of Cordoba, was erected. In the 10th century it reached its maximum splendor, surpassing 100,000 inhabitants and being the most populous city in all of Europe. At that time, it could be considered the epicenter of the entire Iberian Peninsula. Little by little it lost value in favor of Granada, which would become the new capital of the Almohad kingdom. After the Christian reconquest numerous churches and convents would be built in the city, and the cathedral would be built inside the mosque since they considered that it was a work of great value to be demolished. In fact, Carlos V thought that an inch should not have been touched for the construction of the cathedral.
                    <br>
                    Due to the taste of the monarchy of the time, power would gradually shift from Córdoba and Granada to Seville, bringing together a greater number of palaces and religious buildings, craft stalls, industries, etc. being today the capital of all Andalusia and the most populated city.

					Upon entering, the first thing would go through the church of San Juan de Dios and the military command square to reach one of the two most important squares in Córdoba, the Plaza de Tendillas, where one of the tourist offices is located. Nearby is the Circulo de Amigos, a neo-classical mansion with spectacular rooms where people belonging to the upper echelon of Cordoba have used for lunch, dinner or just a coffee. Today it continues to function, but it is no longer such a select club, rather it encompasses other lower social classes.
                    <br>
                    It would then reach the town hall square, where the church of San Pablo and the remains of the Roman theater are located.
                    Nearby is the second most important and most traditional square in Córdoba, Plaza de la Corredera, where there are homogeneous buildings similar to other squares in important towns in Spain. They have this entire square given over to restaurants and bars, having a lot of noise inside.
                    <br>
                    Once seen this area that corresponds to the last 3 centuries years, I would go to the mosque. The next important square to visit was the Plaza del Potro, which will be about 5 centuries old, from the reign of Philip II and where you can see the Casas del Potro, Cordovan houses from 4 centuries ago that have been perfectly preserved until our days. days. At the end of the square you can see the pillar of the Triumph of San Rafael. Not to be confused with the one near the Mosque, which is a different, more important one.
                    <br>
					Having already reached the river, I would contemplate the Roman bridge over the Guadalquivir river. After some photos towards the bridge gate he would arrive at the Plaza del Triunfo where the monument to the triumph of San Rafael is located, in a more spectacular way than the one in the Plaza del Potro. The mosque is already visible and the first door we have in the southwest part is the Door of the Wishing Star. This door is never open but it does connect with the mosque. Opposite is the Palacio de Congresos, which in its day was a hospital, in which the façade stands out, being the late Gothic architecture of the 16th century. After passing through these places, he would arrive at the mosque.
                    <br><br>
                    The mosque-cathedral is one of the most important monuments in Spain and in the world, and it cannot be the most important because there are other wonders that would be difficult to value. It is one of the few buildings that mixes religious architecture of various kinds, such as Islam and Christianity, in its interior. In Toledo the synagogue of Santa María la Blanca mixes the 3 cultures but it is not as important as this building since it was the most important mosque in the peninsula in 7 centuries of Muslim domination and after the reconquest they would carry out a reform to locate the cathedral in its interior with the best materials of the time, however as a Catholic cathedral there are other better works of art to the north.
                    <br>
                    In it we can find all the elements of a cathedral such as its main altarpiece, the choir, the organs, different chapels, and in turn elements of a great mosque such as the mihrab, the dome that is marvelous, the arches of the mosques that in this case contains 3 generations of Mozarabic kings in which pillars from other buildings in the area were used, each one different from the previous one, a huge patio that would be the cloister in a cathedral and the minaret that would end up being transformed into a Christian tower but keeping the details ancient arabs.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>If I had to choose the 10 most important monuments in Spain, I would include the Mosque of Córdoba, the Alhambra in Granada, the Gothic cathedrals of Toledo, Burgos and León, the monastery of El Escorial, the Romanesque of Asturias and Palencia, the Basilica del Pilar in Zaragoza, the Roman theater in Mérida, the Plaza de Trujillo, Gaudí's cathedral in Barcelona and the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. This leaves me with many places full of monuments and places but that do not have any that stand out so much.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    After seeing the mosque-cathedral, I would visit the Jewish quarter, where the old synagogue is located, in the same style as La Sinagoga del Tránsito in Toledo but smaller and less luxurious in its details. Also visit the Cordoba souk, a former meeting point between Arabs, Jews and Christians for trade and meeting. Nearby is the chapel of San Bartolome. Gothic-style chapel retouched on its walls with golden shields and paintings that are still preserved inside. Then it would pass through the square where the bullfighting museum is and in the direction of the Alcázar.
                    <br><br>
					The alcazar is the second most important building in Córdoba after the mosque-cathedral, having 5 huge water ponds surrounded by large gardens. The area is quite large but the fortress is small and can be visited in 1 hour.
                    <br>
                    After seeing the castle, he would pass by the royal stables in which there was room for about 100 groups of horses. Being one of the largest in Spain inside a building.
                    <br>
                    Finally, in the area, I would go to visit the patios from Córdoba that are close to this area, and where the best ones are found and they have won more patios in the contest that is held every year.
                    <br><br>
                    Continuing with the patios in the surroundings of the mosque to see the calleja de las Flores, the most visited street in Córdoba for the decoration of its walls, the amount of flowers, potsherds and details and that it gives precisely towards the tower of the mosque- Cathedral.
                    <br>Close is the Roman past of the city. The Palace of Paez, currently an archaeological museum, presents a large collection of remains from different periods and under its floors lie the remains of what was once the Roman theater of Córdoba.
                    <br>
                    Nearby are some important buildings such as the house of Gongora or the convent of the incarnation.
                    <br><br>
                    Having seen the most important parts of Córdoba, I would be left with the most important religious buildings that would give their names to the different neighborhoods of Córdoba in the late middle ages. The convent church of San Francisco-Eugenio, the basilica of San Pedro, the church of Santiago, the church of La Magdalena, the church of San Lorenzo, the church of San Rafael, the church of San Agustín, which stands out above the others for its paintings being more modern, neoclassical, the Santa Marina de las Aguas, Our Lady of Peace, the Holy Angel and San Nicolas, which is close to where I started my path. The latter is one of the most beautiful and well worth a visit.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to these religious constructions, it would pass through important places for a Cordovan such as the Plaza de Aguayos, the Viana Palace, the courtyard of the Casa de las Campanas and the Plaza de los Capuchinos where the Cristo de los Faroles and two of the churches are located. cited previously.
                    <br><br>
                    With all this I would spend a whole day although, some places I would not enter like the mosque that I had seen a few years ago. <em>If you want <strong>to see Córdoba with peace of mind, at least two days are necessary</strong></em>.

					<p>The province of Córdoba has a multitude of important towns and many beautiful towns that are home to treasures to discover. Its most important towns are and have been Lucena and Cabra. Both towns have many places to see but from my point of view Cabra is more of a town and rural and has more charm since Lucena, having a large industrial estate, has doubled the population of Cabra.
                    <br>
                    The first thing I saw was the most important church, which is Nuestra Señora de la Asunción at the top of the town. It turns out that it has an Arab air, probably because it was a mosque in its day and was transformed into a church, preserving its structure. And it is that Cabra was an important town in the Visigothic era. This is attested to by one of its churches, that of San Juan Bautista, which has a baptismal font from that time inside, hence the name of the church.
                    <br>
                    Later it would become very important in the Muslim era, being the capital of a Cora of Al-Andalus. At that time it was very populated by Jews but due to making things difficult for the Arabs they would take revenge and expel them all, going to a Taifa kingdom more inclined to them like Toledo.
                    <br>
                    The most important thing in Cabra is its palace, that of the Counts of Cabra. I went with a guide who was showing me both the church in which there are important paintings from the Sevillian school and the sacristy, the patio and the most important room of the castle. It is currently a school and the classrooms are in some rooms of the castle.
                    <br>
                    Also walking through its streets visit some of its churches such as Santo Domingo de Guzman and San Juan de Dios and the already mentioned San Juan Bautista. It is also worth stopping at the main square where the town hall is.
                    <br>
                    After a good meal in a restaurant next to the town park, I would visit my friend Agustín in Rute. After a tapas in a good bar we would go to the Iznajar reservoir where nautical activities are carried out throughout the year.
                    <br>
                    Having seen the reservoir, we would go up to the town and visit the castle. This castle has unbeatable views of the entire reservoir and the town. Near it we have some places of interest such as the comedy house, a square adorned with red potsherds and some ceramics from the area. Lastly, we would descend to visit the brotherhood of Nuestra Señora de la Piedad and its church, very austere but with several valuable paintings. After that I would return to my hostel in Badalatosa.

					<p>After having visited the town of Cabra, I had no choice but to visit <strong>Lucena</strong>, lest someday I meet a Lusitanian and have visited Cabra and not Lucena, since there are quarrels between these two peoples since time immemorial. The highlight of Lucena is its moral castle where the city's archaeological museum is located.
                    <br>
                    On leaving, I would visit the church of San Mateo, which has one of the most beautiful chapels in all Andalusia. It is also decorated with the coats of arms of the Dukes of Lucena. In addition to the town hall square there are numerous religious buildings and palaces. The convent of the Madre de Dios, the church of San Francisco, the church of San Pedro Martir, the church of San Juan de Dios and that of Nuestra Señora Carmen.
                    <br>
                    There is also the sanctuary of the Virgin of Araceli about 8 kilometers away, one of the Marian temples in Spain.
                    <br>
                    As palaces we have that of the counts of Santa Ana where they hold numerous exhibitions and events and the house of the Mora.
                    <br><br>
                    The next town to be visited Baena I expected more from it. Despite being an important town, it does not have so many monuments. The best thing about the town is the Plaza de la Constitución where the town hall is located, which is quite large and there are several good restaurants.
                    <br>
					From afar you can see the castle that despite being large, its restoration has not been very successful since the materials used are of low quality and it looks very artificial and forced. Inside it barely has an empty space for the most part. <em>If the city council had forced the use of materials more similar to the originals and had filled the space with a tent or tower where archaeological objects found in the area could be placed as a museum, it would have acquired greater importance.</em>
                    <br>
                    The religious buildings are the church of Santa María Mayor.
                    <br><br>
                    Near Baena on the way to Zuheros we can pass through a little-known town, <strong>Luque</strong>. This town has an imposing church with a Mudejar ceiling, very pretty for the size of this town. It also has a defensive castle that is undergoing restoration and when it is finished, due to the enclave where it is located, it would have an additional tourist attraction. Its opening date is scheduled for 2023.
                    <br><br>
                    Once he arrived in <strong>Zuheros</strong>, he would go to see if he could make a reservation at the tourist office to see the Cueva de los Bats, since he had not been able to contact him by phone during the day. This cave that has 5 daily visits is very popular and the maximum number of people in the cave is 30 people to damage it as little as possible. The town is one of the most beautiful in Spain due to where it is located, in a rocky area where its old castle stands out, of which today the main wall and the keep remain. The beauty of this castle is that it took advantage of the rock as a natural wall and gives it an air of a movie. Another important building is the museum of popular customs. Once I had walked through several of its streets, I set off towards the next town.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Priego de Córdoba</strong>, like Zuheros, is on the list of the most beautiful towns in Spain, however historically it has much more to offer. The castle is very large and has an interpretation center in the keep. Very close to the castle is the church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, huge with a neoclassical interior and a beautiful dome that envies nothing to the castle. Around the church, there are a series of alleys with Cordovan patios where it is worth strolling and taking pictures, the street of the jasmines stands out above the others.
                    <br>
                    This town also has the Reales Carnicerías building, a 16th-century building that served as the town's slaughterhouse and market. It has been recently restored and its spiral staircase and patio are famous. In addition to these unique buildings, it has important religious buildings such as the church of San Nicasio de la Aurora, which has numerous decorations on the sides and paintings. This church is even more beautiful than the Assumption. In addition, there is the church of San Francisco, of the same style but of lesser importance.
                    <br><br>
                    Once seen, he would return to <strong>Rute</strong> for the carnival. Rute is the town of Córdoba whose carnival celebrations are more important and people from different towns move. This fairly large town does not have a unique heritage as the ancient town of Rute was destroyed in the Arab-Christian wars. However, it has numerous museums related to the gastronomy of the area, such as the anise museum, the ham museum, the chocolate museum, the aguardiente museum, the sugar museum and the marzipan museum. Rute having a large industry related to pastry and livestock.

                <h1>Dia 4, crossing the province of Seville to reach Ronda</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_4_sevilla_pueblos.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_4_sevilla_pueblos"/><br>                
					<p>After seeing a large part of the province of Córdoba (remaining in the north of the province) my intention was to visit the towns of Málaga and especially Ronda. To do this, he would cross the east of the province of Seville and visit several of its towns where he had never been.
                    <br>
                    The first of these towns is Estepa. This town is known for its Polvorones, since it is the queen brand of Spain and all Spaniards have eaten them at some point. I went up to the top of the town to see its castle or what was left of it. Nearby is the convent of San Francisco, which was closed, and the church of Santa Clara. This church is very old, possibly there was some construction prior to the foundation of the convent in the 16th century.
                    <br>
                    What really surprised me about this town is the quality of its churches. The church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción and the church of Carmen stand out. Other more common churches that of San Sebastian. Above all the church towers rises the tower of Victory. This tower was part of an old convent that suffered the effects of the French invasion and confiscation. Due to the state it presented, it would finally be destroyed but the tower was not touched and it is the one that remains today.
                    <br><br>
                    Then I moved to see <strong>Ecija</strong> to the northeast. This town is one of the most important in Seville, both for its population and for its history. Écija was one of the most important towns of Roman times and there are numerous ruins and vestiges that speak for themselves. The Benameji Palace brings together a museum with objects from all the surrounding towns. Its patio and its stairs are very beautiful, and it has very large mosaic floors that could well compete with those of the Mérida museum. From the same period is a Roman pond found in the town hall square. In the square, the Benameji viewpoint and the Silk Guild viewpoint house stand out, which were used to observe the festivities by the Marquis of Benameji. The square is very wide and you can see some religious buildings apart from the town hall that when I was there, they had it under restoration.
                    <br>
                    Those buildings are the church of Santa María, San Juan and Santa Ana and the convent of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Very close to this square we find the very large church of San Gil.
                    <br>
                    Écija has very beautiful palaces such as Peñaflor with a large patio and Valdehermoso, which has a Renaissance façade and beautiful balconies. Behind you can see the tower of the church of San Juan, in the Mudejar style, with an air of several of Estepa or one of Jerez de los Caballeros in Badajoz.
                    <br>
                    Nearby are other palaces such as Bobadilla or Lasso Vega. Already being noon I would look for a restaurant and eat in the sevillista brotherhood next to the church of Santa Cruz. A large square with a very large church. Nearby is the church of San Pablo and Santo Domingo, one of the most valuable baroque churches in the city and in the area. Another church to visit is the Convent of the PUrisima Concepción and the Convent of the Holy Trinity.
                    <br>
					Other palaces are the one of Cardenas and Prados Castellano, the palace of Santaella, the one of Justica also called house of the Tomasas, the palace of Garcilaso and the one of the Eagles.
                    <br>
                    <em>With all this, the heritage of Écija is enormous, and although they say that Carmona or Osuna are the cities with the most heritage after Seville, in my opinion Écija is the second city with the most heritage after Seville.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Having visited Écija in a record time of 5 or 6 hours I went down to see <strong>Osuna</strong>. I arrived around 5:00 p.m. and the first thing I saw was the Las Canteras preserve. It is a large area where the rock was obtained to make most of the buildings in Osuna since Roman times. Today they have transformed the relief of the walls making figures of people or animals and cleaning the interior to be able to hold events. They have also created a museum and some compare it to Petra because of its reddish color and the figures they have created, all of which are recent.
                    <br><br>
                    Later I would go to try to enter the Collegiate Church, however the last guided tour was at 5:45 p.m., so I could not enter. On the way I saw the church of La Merced, which has a certain air of the decorated churches of Écija but this time without color. Not far away is the university that you can enter to see its patio
                    <br>
                    The collegiate church keeps a treasure inside and it is the Holy Sepulchre, which is a royal pantheon where the Dukes of Osuna were buried and has several works of art related to death.
                    <br>
                    Other buildings of interest in Osuna are the palace of Miguel Reina Jurado, the palace of Cepeda with its beautiful coat of arms or the palace of the Marquis of Gomera, with a large patio now converted into a hotel.
                    <br><br>
					As religious buildings are the church of San Agustin, that of Santo Domingo which is enormous, that of the convent of Nuestra Señora del Carmen or that of San Carlos el Real.
                    <br><br>
                     Other important buildings are the municipal deposit or the cilla of the collegiate council that has the most spectacular baroque façade in the province of Seville. The cover, off-centre, stands out for its almost sculptural entity; It is framed by Corinthian columns that start from bulbous pedestals and support a mixtilinear cornice, very trimmed, with an undulating baquetón around the lintel. On the cornice stands the sculptural representation in a round shape of the Giralda, Santas Justa and Rufina and the jars of lilies, surrounded by another mixtilinear molding and crowning the whole with a very trimmed top like a pediment.
                     <br><br>
                     With this I would go straight to Ronda where I had the hostel.

                <h1>Day 5, visit to the province of Malaga</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_5_ronda.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_5_ronda"/><br>                
					<p><strong>Ronda is considered by many to be the most beautiful town in Spain</strong>. This is due to multiple factors. One of them is the mixture of cultures and architectures within the town that passed from Christian to Muslim hands and back to Christian hands. In addition, the city is in a complicated orography so there are multiple bridges connecting the different neighborhoods, the most famous is the New Bridge that connects the entire historic center with the part of the last three centuries. It has also perfectly preserved most of the religious buildings, although many buildings in the Arab quarter, such as the baths, are not in good condition.
                    <br>
                    The fact of having been one of the best defensive cities due to the heights at which it is and to having the natural wall of the mountain gives it an air of a movie and if we add to it the great history it has and that after the reconquest it continued to endow itself with good buildings such as the bullring and some nearby palaces make it the second destination in the province after the capital.
                    <br><br>
                    My hostel was 20 meters from the new bridge and the hostel, which was the first thing I would see. To enter the bullring you have to pay so you would see it from the outside. To take the photo with the new bridge, it can be done either from the new area, either from the interpretation area of ​​the bridge that is difficult to enter, or from the viewpoint from the old area. That's the one that worked best for me. This photo can also be taken from the Mondragon Palace.
                    <br><br>
                    To say that in Ronda you have to pay almost everywhere and they are not a big deal. Although there is a bracelet or joint ticket that for 15 euros you can see many places, not counting the church of Santa María, which is separate. This is due to the fact that the majority of foreign tourists who travel to Malaga visit Ronda because of its proximity and because of the setting and surroundings of this town, which is spectacular. <em>However, cities such as Écija and Osuna are home to religious buildings and palaces that give a thousand turns to those of Ronda</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I visited the New part, in addition to the bridge and the inn, I went to see the Plaza del Socorro and the church, one of the most visited squares in Ronda. Also the convent of La Merced on the outskirts or the church of Santa Cecilia del Padre Jesús, the temple of the hanged men or the Salvatierra palace, very close to the old Ronda. Very close to this palace would be the Old Bridge that gives access to a slope next to the walls to see the historic center. From this bridge you can see the medieval bridge of the Islamic Ronda, the Arab baths and several houses and ruins from that time. This part is outside the wall. Crossing the bridge you can see the gate of Carlos V and going up the hill the house of the Moorish King. A house with a baroque facade full of details.
                    <br>
                    In the center we come to the main square, with the church of Santa María la Mayor, the town hall and the convent of Las Clarisas, with a baroque church. This square is the most important in Ronda. Not far to the west and on the edge of the city is the Church of the Holy Spirit that connects with the wall and the city gate. One can climb the wall and walk a few meters. Returning to the main square you can see the remains of the citadel and we can already see other important buildings such as the Mondragon Palace, Don Bosco's house, the Joaquin Peinado museum in a small square surrounded by palaces now converted into hotels. It is also worth visiting the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and see the mural next to the Puente Nuevo de Ronda Viajeros Románticos made of tiles.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_5_malaga_pueblos.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_5_malaga_pueblos"/><br> 
					Once I had visited Ronda, which I could also see at night walking around the new part, I would retrace my steps until I reached <strong>Setenil de las Bodegas</strong>. My intention was to have gone before Ronda and then go to Antequera, but due to the route I took at the last moment I had to leave it. Also, if you go to Setenil, you have to try its delicious grilled meat in one of its restaurants.
                    <br>
                    Setenil de las Bodegas is a town nestled in the rock. There is a dry creek and on both sides there are caves in the rock. They were excavated centuries ago to create taverns that are now restaurants. In this way they took advantage of the natural cold of the shade and of the interior to preserve food and drinks. As it is very hot it was easy to take shelter and from the cold also at night.
                    <br><br>
                    The caves have different names, the most important are the caves of surplus and sun. At the top of the town is the Church of the Incarnation built on the old mosque and its wall, which is of Arab origin. After seeing the town a bit, he would eat the specialty of the house, a good roast knuckle. To do this you would have to queue at one of its restaurants for about 15 minutes. There the star dishes are the entrecotes, and the grilled lamb chops.
                    <br><br>
                    After visiting this very touristy town that despite being February was full and I headed towards Archidona. A lesser-known town in the province of Malaga that is home to the only preserved mosque in the province. This 9th century mosque rises above the town in the old citadel. Once visited, it would go down to the town, where it would enter the main square. This square is called Plaza Ochavada due to the distribution of its blocks in 8 parts. It is one of the best Andalusian baroque-style squares and that day they had finished dismantling the stage where the carnival had been held.
                    <br><br>
                    As heritage it has the church of La Victoria, the convent of the nuns Mínimas and the church of Santa Ana, which is the main church of the town and is located at the highest point of the town below the mountain.
                    <br>
                    After seeing this town, I would make my way to the center of Antequera, specifically the Naranjito hotel.

                <h1>Dia 6, Antequera y llegada a Málaga</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/blog/blog22/mapa_viajes8_6_antequera.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_6_antequera"/>              
					<p>Antequera is the town of Malaga with the most heritage and history in the province, including the capital. However, the environment is not as beautiful as Ronda and it does not face the Mediterranean Sea, so these disadvantages have made it lose some importance.
                    <br>
                    <em>It has a great heritage, beginning with Iberian and Roman remains, preserved in a large museum, an Arab citadel, a collegiate church and numerous churches of interest, as well as a large number of palaces and noble houses. As if that were not enough, it has the best preserved Neolithic dolmens in Europe. That is why about 10 years ago they were included in the UNESCO world heritage list in which Spain already has 50 assets. For all this, it is an obligatory destination if you go to Malaga.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    The first thing I saw was the church of San Sebastian in front of my hotel. This church is very large and could well be a collegiate or co-cathedral. It also has a wooden choir and large organs as well as several chapels, elements typical of cathedrals. Nearby is the Plaza del Coso Viejo, where the convent of Santa Catalina de Siena is located, which contains a very curious altarpiece adorned with several coats of arms. In front is the Nájera Palace where the city museum is located. In this palace the highlight to see is the staircase with its dome and paintings as well as the courtyard. Inside the museum there are many religious elements coming from the churches or from the city or from its deposits of goods. Also a funerary urn where a coffin was found. The top floor is dedicated to a painter from this century who made paintings based on other famous paintings but introduced changes.
                    <br><br>
                    As soon as I leave the museum I find the historical archive. I head towards the archaeological site of the dolmens passing through spaces such as the municipal market, the monastery of San Zoilo, which contains a high-quality polychrome Mudejar coffered ceiling, the Plaza de Santiago with the church whose walls are painted like tapestries and the large church of Santa Eufemia. This church does not attract attention from the outside but inside it is one of the most beautiful in Antequera, being of baroque style.
                    <br><br>
                    Arriving at the enclosure of the dolmens, I will first see the Viera dolmen, which is like a narrow cave, separated by the ancient dolmens and the Menga dolmen, the most spectacular, which preserves the only well discovered in the world from the Neolithic era, more than 3500 years before Christ, entirely preserved. This is due to the fact that the well was under the dolmen, which would in turn be buried, which has made this miraculous conservation possible.
                    <br>
                    The most fabulous dolmen is that of Tholos el Romeral, which is located outside this archaeological area and is like a circular cave. It is amazing that these formations were built so many years ago.
                    <br><br>
					Once I had seen the dolmens, I went to see the Iglesia del Carmen. It is recognized as the most beautiful in Antequera due to its polychrome Mudejar coffered ceiling, its floor plan and its baroque-style wooden altarpiece. Having seen this church and the dolmens, you would see the other two jewels of Antequera, the citadel and the collegiate church. The entrance to the citadel is paid but with a teacher's card the entrance to both sites I think I remember was about 7 euros. The citadel is recommended for the views, although there is little to see inside. Inside the collegiate church it is almost empty and it is a very bland building but on the outside it is a great building. Right now it no longer functions as a church, but rather as a museum, which takes away its religious air.
                    <br><br>
                    From above you can see the entire city seeing the different towers of the churches and neighborhoods. The most important religious buildings that you would later see are the Brotherhood of Cristo de las Aguas, the church of Santa María de Jesús in Plaza del Portichuelo, the convent of Santo Domingo, the church of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios, the church of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios, the convent of the Madre de Dios and Monteagudo, the church of the Holy Trinity and the church of San Pedro.
                    <br><br>
                    Also worth seeing is the courtyard of the town hall, a former palace.
                    <br>
                    With all this, Antequera is a city with a lot of heritage but it does not have any building that stands out or that makes it special compared to other Andalusian cities. However, it has the dolmens that are unique in the world, which gives it a special appeal. That is why it is becoming more and more visited and its full tourist potential is being developed.
                    <br>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/blog/blog22/mapa_viajes8_6_antequera-malaga.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_6_antequera-malaga"/>
                    <br>  
					In the afternoon I would set out for Malaga and on the way I would see the Torcal Natural Park. This park has some unique rock formations because in another time the water covered everything and that area that was filled with a rock formation would receive its erosion leaving shapes that seem to be taken from another planet. There are many hiking trails in the area. When I went it was sunny and you could visit, however as it got late the wind increased and due to being at altitude the weather sensation can be very low. The best season to visit is spring since in summer due to high temperatures it is totally inadvisable.

					<p>In Malaga I stayed in a hostel in the west, 5 kilometers from the center. Even being early March the weather was quite good.
                    <br>
                    Having parked near the Faculty of Economic Sciences, the center was 1km away. As I went down I saw buildings of little value like a church or the brotherhood of Cristo de la Sangre.
                    <br>
                    Already in the center you would enter the tourist office, which is located in a beautiful neoclassical palace made for the society of friends of the country. Interesting is the church that adjoins the palace, that of Cristo de la Salud and its beautiful dome, decorated with different baroque paintings.
                    <br>
                    Very close to this church is the church of the Sacred Heart, which despite being quite modern, from the 19th century, is very beautiful, neoclassical in style. Next to it there is a square where the Thyssen Palace is, which houses a painting museum inside. Also in this area is the church of San Juan Bautista, the most beautiful in my opinion in Malaga after the cathedral. It is of neoclassical style also with baroque altarpieces and different chapels to the Virgin and Jesus. The church is crowned by a beautiful 4-storey tower, which reaches the height of the cathedral tower.
                    <br>
                    After seeing all these churches I would go to the west bank, visiting the central market of Malaga and the church of Santo Domingo de Guzman, which is quite modern and has no cultural interest. Already pulling towards the cathedral and its surroundings, the first thing I see is the great episcopal palace that is next to it. It stands out in front of the great fountain in the square. The interior of the cathedral is quite voluminous being the tallest cathedral in height with large windows and stained glass windows that make the interior itself look like a large painted mural. It is all in neoclassical style. On the other side is the Santo Tomas Hospital.
                    <br>
                    Heading towards the citadel, we passed by the Albeniz cinema and I visited the Roman interpretation center where the Roman theater is located, recovered for the city not many years ago. From there you go up to the Alcazaba and the Gibralfaro castle from where you can see the entire city. This time I would not go up and go to the city museum. It is very worthwhile to learn about the Phoenician origins of this city, Malaka. There are many objects from the Roman period and somewhat less from the Arab period. From there I will go to the beach, La Malagueta. Going through Cervantes avenue where the town hall is located. I will also go through the park of the port and the lighthouse. There is a large area of ​​restaurants and shops there. With this I will conclude the visit to Malaga, in just over 5 hours. If you go up to the citadel you can easily go the whole day.

					<p>Leaving very early, the first stop will be <strong>Vélez Málaga</strong>, taking the A7. When I arrive I park in one of the two highest parts of the city, the hermitage of the Virgen de los Remedios. The first stop will be at the palace of the Marquis of Beniel. The patio, the staircase and the Mudejar ceiling stand out. Nearby is the convent of San Francisco, very modest on the outside but home to incredible religious altarpieces. The baroque ceilings and dome have some paintings. One of the chapels has the original paintings from 5 centuries ago. Nearby is the largest and main church in Vélez, the church of San Juan Bautista. Its interior is very simple with some wooden carvings of saints. Next to San Juan Bautista is the town's granary where exhibitions are often held, the remains of the wall, the town's gate and the Royal fountain.
                    <br><br>
                    As museums we have the house of Cervantes that tells of its relationship with the town and the archaeological museum of Vélez Málaga, also on an old mansion. This museum is highly recommended as its admission is free because it gives you a lot of information about the history of the city. Finally, it is well worth going up to the citadel both to have a view of the entire city and to visit the church of María Encarnación where the Holy Week museum is located. I liked this museum a lot because it was very well cared for and because I could see the church inside. This church was originally a mosque and you can see a lot in the lines of the walls and its structure.
                    <br><br>
                    Having seen Vélez and wanting to see the inland towns with the aim of reaching the A92, I will stop at <strong>Alhama de Granada</strong>. This town is quite high, 895 meters and immediately if you come from the coast you notice everything colder. Here as soon as he arrived he would eat in a good restaurant, the Raya. The specialty of the house is choto, stewed kid. The castle of the village is quite ugly, being empty inside and in private hands. The characteristic image of the town is that of the convent of Carmen or that of the slope that goes up to the church of La Encarnación. Apart from these buildings and the medieval beauty of its streets, we have the house of the Inquisition and the old prison that today is the town's interpretation center.
                    <br>
                    Following my path along the A92 I will arrive at <strong>Guadix</strong>, one of the oldest cities in Andalusia, already important in the Iberian era in the 6th century BC. It has heritage from all eras from the Roman era, with the remains of a Roman theater recently and which has been included in the list of Assets of Cultural Interest (BIC) in 2016, passing through the remains of the Arab citadel until reaching the formidable cathedral (which was built on the cathedral whose origin was a Visigothic temple). It is for this reason a city that is of great historical importance and that is the episcopal seat of the area, together with Baza.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from the cathedral, which is worth visiting inside, there is the Royal hospital that you did not visit, and the church of Santiago. This church has a very well-kept Mudejar ceiling and a very elegant Baroque altarpiece. It reminds me a lot of the church of San Francisco in Cáceres, due to the white color and the shape of its tower, although the one in Cáceres has two towers. It also appears to have originally had a mosque plan. Another church to see is that of Las Angustias.
                    <br>
                    Very close to the cathedral is the main square and the town hall, an architectural jewel full of coats of arms of double-headed eagles. Also the palaces such as that of the Marquises of Villa Alegre with their two large coats of arms and the Episcopal Palace. At night I will arrive at my hotel in Baza.

                <h1>Dia 9, from Baza to Lorca, Murcia</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_9_malaga-baza.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_9_malaga-baza"/><br>                 
					<p><strong>Baza</strong>is a city with a long history known for its archaeological discovery as important as the Lady of Baza. This site is from the Iberian era and dates back to the 4th century BC. On my visit, I first went to the main square where I could see the collegiate church and the town hall. A square in which the co-cathedral stands out above all of the above. In it two large shields stand out, on the column and the doors that give it a certain medieval air. Inside it is Gothic in style with ribbed arches but they do not have important altarpieces.
                    <br>
                    Inside the city is the archeology museum that is located in the old Renaissance-style town hall. It has many remains of Iberian sites in the area, as well as Roman and Arab sites. The most important thing is related to the lady of Baza for which there is also an interpretation center from where it was extracted on the outskirts of the city (the old city of Basti). Remember that it is a replica since the original is in the archaeological museum of Madrid. We also have the royal room with everything related to the title of city that they would win in the reign of the Catholic Monarchs. This has a very successful Mudejar coffered ceiling.
                    <br>
                    Other interesting buildings are an old fountain made in the times of Philip III with his royal coat of arms, the Arab baths that have been recently restored and are intact and complete. Together with the baths of Jaén and Granada, they are the best preserved in Andalusia. This is because they were buried under the old street.
                    <br>
                    As religious architecture, in addition to the collegiate church, there is the church of San Juan with a Mudejar coffered ceiling and the dressing room of the church of Los Dolores, which has not been restored and is at high risk of being damaged. It is a real gem above the church that is not open to the public. Another building that is undergoing restoration is the monastery of San Jerónimo.
                    <br>
                    After Baza I went to the Lady of Baza site and from there I would head towards the province of Almería. The first town in Almería that I saw was <strong>Vélez Rubio</strong>. This town has as its most important claim a great church, that of the incarnation that has two large shields on its cover. The largest shields I have seen in a church of this type. In addition, the church is huge and has a quite elegant baroque altarpiece. The rest of the church is quite sober. A few kilometers further is its smaller town, Vélez Blanco, which despite being smaller has much more heritage and more charm to be visited. The growth of Vélez Rubio is due to connecting with the road that connects the central area of ​​Andalusia with the east.
                    <br><br>
					<strong>Vélez Blanco</strong>, is a town that must have been important in the Caliphate era, where there was a mosque and a fortress that defended the town at the top. What remained of the Arab fortress would pass through different hands after the reconquest until it reached the Vélez family, a dominant family in all of Andalusia from the reign of Philip II. This would build a castle and make great changes and reforms over the years, creating a palace inside with many marble figures and windows with all kinds of details, as well as gargoyles or shields. The large balcony stands out through which you can observe everything that happens in the town since the castle is quite high above the lowest level of the town. The courtyard of the castle in the nineteenth century would be sold to the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the palace would be abandoned. The Junta de Andalucía would buy it and since then it has received several reforms. Access to the last one has been ensured and different panels have been placed with the history of the castle as well as closed and well isolated different rooms. It is currently in the process of a final reform to achieve a very similar appearance to what it had, making replicas of the original patio of the one found in New York.
                    <br>
                    In the town, apart from the castle, there is a church in ruins, which is supposed to have been the mosque of the Alcazaba before it, and a large church near the Calle Mayor and the town hall. It also has a convent, that of San Luis, which dates from the early 17th century and has a fairly elaborate façade with coats of arms of the family of the Marquis of Requenses, who ordered it to be built.
                    <br><br>
                    Before reaching my destination and due to the proximity of Cuevas de Almanzora to the city of Lorca, I would decide to stop there. <strong>Lorca</strong> belongs to the province of Murcia, which would have already covered 8 provinces on this trip, without having set foot in Huelva or Jaen in Andalusia. <em>Really where I have focused the trip the most is in Córdoba, Málaga and Almería, although I have known many important towns of Seville and Granada that I had never visited</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    As in Lorca I couldn't park in the center as there are many cars, and almost all car parks are paid, so I went straight up to the castle. This castle is built on the old Arab citadel. Within the vast area of ​​its walls there was a mosque and a synagogue since many Jews inhabited these lands. Today the Lorca National Parador is located there, a modern building with all the comforts isolated from noise and urban traffic.
                    <br>
					When you see the castle from the outside, since you arrive around 6:00 p.m., which is when it closes, you walk along the wall and see from above the size of the old town of Lorca compared to the entire new area. They have made a multitude of modern multi-storey buildings on the main street, the N-340, however these buildings do not extend beyond that street from which it seems as if you are in a much larger city. That street houses major stores and major brands. In the center I started by visiting the collegiate church, a huge building that houses large paintings inside.
                    <br>
                    Nearby, the mayor's house stands out, with a very impressive side coat of arms of the same quality as those found in palaces in Extremadura, from the 16th century, and the craftsman's house with the coat of arms of Carlos V on its façade. The town hall next to the collegiate church and the Plaza Mayor does not leave you indifferent, in a Renaissance style with large coats of arms from the Bourbon reign from the early 18th century. Walking through its streets, you would see one of the best palaces of Castilian architecture of the 16th century, the Palace of Guevara. Inside we can find the reproduction of the old library and pharmacy or apothecary, as well as large paintings on the staircase. Another palace of interest is that of Ruano, from the end of the 19th century, in a more classic style that stands out for its imperial stairs and its neo-Nasrid-style meeting room in allusion to the architecture of the Alhambra palace in Granada.
                    <br>
                    Religious buildings apart from the collegiate church we find the church of San Pedro, San Mateo, San Francisco and the church of Santiago. These churches are characterized by tall towers and baroque altarpieces. The one with the largest proportions is that of San Mateo followed by that of San Francisco. In the annex building there is a patio with a reproduction of the Lourdes cave with the Virgin.
                    <br><br>
                    At night I would stay at the Perejil hostel, very close to Cuevas de Almanzora and Águilas.

                <h1>Day 10, knowing the towns of Almería</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_10_almeria_pueblos.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_10_almeria_pueblos"/><br>               
					<p>The first town of the day would be <strong>Cuevas de Almanzora</strong>. This town has its castle as a claim. It was ordered to be built by the Vélez family and within its walls is the art museum as well as the tourist office where there is a museum about the town. The town church is a huge one-story church.
                    <br>
                    On the outskirts of the town are the Calguerín caves that I saw from afar. There is a Senegalese settlement that has settled in the area. There is a lot of rubble there and even the boats with which they arrived. They do not seem conflictive people but the place is better not to visit it.
                    <br><br>
                    Going down the road you would reach the next town of interest, <strong>Mojácar</strong>. This town is famous for its beaches that are 3 kilometers from it. It is built on a mountain and is full of slopes where the predominant color is white. They are little houses with balconies and with decorations on the windows in some of them. It has a fairly common church in the center of the town but it is undoubtedly liked for the theme of the general architecture of southern Andalusia, the white villages and for being nestled in the mountains. From above you can see all the beaches. Near the beach there are many <em>resorts</em> and hotels and the Mojácar National Parador.
                    <br><br>
                    Then it would go south towards <strong>Níjar</strong>. This town has a more peculiar historical center in which its houses are white. It has a tower at the top of the town where you can see the whole thing. The church is old stone with a Mudejar wooden roof. The town is one of the beautiful towns in Spain but I, like Mojácar, did not see anything special in them to deserve that position apart from the geographical location where they are located. Níjar is surrounded by a desert area. Lastly, he would visit the capital, <strong>Almería</strong> in the afternoon.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_10_almeria.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_10_almeria"/><br>    
					Almería is one of the provincial capitals of Andalusia with less attractiveness in Andalusia, only led by Huelva. Although right now it has little to offer, the truth is that it has enough potential to be able to offer the visitor more. It could be almost at the level of Malaga since its cathedral is older and on the outside it reminds more of a fortress than a cathedral.
                    <br>
                    The enclosure of the Arab citadel is enormous and in fact it is being restored and reformed to enhance its value. It has several old stone churches that could date from the fifteenth century, shortly after the capture of the city by the Christians. The church of Santiago, with wooden ceilings and baroque altarpieces, late Gothic, that of San Pedro with a neoclassical ceiling and a baroque altarpiece that indicates that it is more recent. The church of the convent of Santa Clara in the same style as that of Santiago and the sanctuary of the Virgen de las Aguas, very similar to that of Santiago, with a late Gothic style. It also has palaces such as that of the Puche from the 17th century and houses of important figures in Spanish history such as García Lorca. Some of the city's museums, such as the Guitar Museum, are striking.
                    <br>
                    Apart from the cathedral and the citadel, the main attraction of the city is the port that can be visited and the beach. Between the two you can see a very important logistics structure in Spain from the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, such as the English cable that was where the trains that brought minerals passed to unload directly onto the ships. Currently there is an ambitious project to restore it. Also very close is the French cable, which is not as complex as the English one and is quite short. Almería beach is one of the best beaches in a provincial capital of superior quality even to that of Malaga. It is very clean and has hardly any stones that prevent the bathroom.
                    <br><br>
                    With all this, I would return to the hostel with the heritage Almería more or less seen. And it is that Almería is one of the provinces of Spain with less monumental heritage, but it makes up for it with its beautiful beaches that attract thousands of tourists every year.

                <h1>Day 11, walking along the beaches of vera and back to Toledo</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v08/mapa_viajes8_11_almeria-toledo.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes8_11_almeria-toledo"/><br>
					<p>The last day I would visit <strong>Vera</strong>, a town very close to Almería beach, which in fact the town that has the beaches is called Vera Playa. The town has a fairly old church that had noble coats of arms and that of the Catholic kings that are removed from the façade and another one that is very poorly preserved. They have made a concrete replica in a building attached to the church. In the main square besides the church is the town hall.
                    <br><br>
                    Other notable buildings is the bullring that has a bullfighting museum with bullfighters' costumes, photographs or different old documents related to the fight in that town.
                    <br>
                    Vera's beaches are among the best in Spain, with a large area from the sea to the beachfront. In addition, a part is located next to a pine forest, which means that it preserves that natural and virgin air.
                    </p>
