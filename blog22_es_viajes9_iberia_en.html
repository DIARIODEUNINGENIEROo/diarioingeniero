                <em>April 8 to April 14, 2022</em>  
                <h1>Day 1, Toledo to Valladolid</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v09/mapa_viajes9_1_segovia.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes9_1_segovia"/><br>
					<p>The first day I decided before going to Valladolid to go through one of the jewels that the Spanish royal family has left us, the palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. This palace gives its name to the place called <strong>Real Sitio de San Ildefonso</strong>. To get there from Toledo or Madrid you have to pass the Sierra de Madrid and Navacerrada where one of the most visited ski resorts by Madrid residents is located.
                    <br>
                    In addition to the palace, an attached collegiate church of great value was built and there is the Royal Glass Factory. The palace can be visited but inside, as in the collegiate church, they do not allow taking photographs, so unless you have a mobile phone and you are recording, you will not be able to take a souvenir of the place. The most interesting rooms are those of the classical heroes, which are full of alabaster and bronze statues, the tapestry room, which is from the time of Charles V of Dutch origin, and the royal room.
                    <br><br>
                    After eating, he would go on his way to <strong>Segovia</strong>. Parking on the outskirts very close to the first stone of the Aqueduct within the city that has the aqueduct carved on the outside. From there I will continue walking to the Postigo del Consuelo. I went up Calle de San Juan, on my way to Plaza del Conde Cheste. In this square are the Casa de las Cadenas, the Casa de los Marqueses de Lozoya, the niche of the Virgen de los Remedios and, further towards the center, the Palacio del Quintanar. This palace can be visited and usually puts on exhibitions, in this case there was an exhibition of photographs of different monuments in Italy. Pulling further to the outskirts we find another important museum in Segovia, Zuloaga, which is inside the old church of San Juan de los Caballeros.
                    <br>
                    Once I have seen this, I will head towards another of the most important points in Segovia, the Plazuela de San Martín and the Plaza de Medina del Campo, which are attached. On the way I will pass through the Plaza del Doctor Laguna seeing different exteriors of palaces such as San Facundo or the tower of Arias de Dávila. Nearby is the Esteban Vicente museum and the Casa de los Mesa. In this square of Medina del Campo is one of the most important and oldest churches dating from 1100, the church of San Martín. It is a beautiful church in Romanesque style, with an arched entrance decorated with carved figures on the capitals and a rear door with carvings of the 4 evangelists. One of the few preserved Romanesque churches in the center of a provincial capital, since many were destroyed to build others with more modern styles. Inside it has a more modern, neoclassical part with a baroque altarpiece.

                    Very close we already have one of the two most touristic points of the city, the main square that houses the town hall and the cathedral in its proximity. The other point is the Plaza del Alcázar that I would later visit. In it we also have the church of San Miguel, in Gothic style and from the same period as the cathedral. The cathedral of Segovia is late Gothic, specifically it is the newest Gothic style cathedral in Spain since it began to be built in the 16th century when the Renaissance style was already in use in Europe. Like important cathedrals in Spain such as Toledo, Berruguete would also work on the sculptures here and Jose de Churriguera as well as Gregorio Fernández, great sculptors of that time. In addition, the first printed book in Spain is preserved, the Sinoidal de Aguilafuente, which is exhibited in the cathedral museum. Near the cathedral is the church of San Andres, which has a very valuable Baroque altarpiece. This church was originally a mosque and it is clearly seen in the arches of its tower, a possible minaret.
                    <br>
                    Near the cathedral we find the path that leads to the fortress. Calle de Velarde preserves one of the original arches that covered the internal wall that flanked the city on the way to the alcazar. This is the Claustra arch. At the end of the streets that come together we go outside the old city wall and there is the alcazar. From it you can dominate the entire exterior from where we can take good panoramic photographs. On the outskirts we find the monastery of Santa María del Parral in the distance, and closer the church of Vera Cruz, of the Order of Malta, the convent of San Juan de la Cruz, and the sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de Fuencisla. All these buildings are assets of cultural interest and deserve a visit that on the next trip to Segovia I will be able to talk about them.
                    <br><br>
					The Alcázar of Segovia, dating from the early 12th century, is one of the most famous medieval castles in the world and one of the most visited monuments in Spain. Twenty-two kings have passed through its rooms, in addition to some of the most prominent figures in history.
                    <br>
                    Its imposing profile rises majestically over the Eresma valley and is a symbol of the Old City of Segovia, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.
                    <br>
                    Palace and fortress of the Kings of Castile, its layout reflects the splendor of the Court during the Middle Ages, and its walls have witnessed battles, palace intrigues, royal weddings and amazing events. In its thousand-year-old existence, the Alcázar has been a Roman fort, a medieval fortress, a royal palace, a custodian of the royal treasure, a state prison, a Royal College of Artillery and a General Military Archive.
                    <br>
                    In 1862 it suffered a fire and all the coffered ceilings were reduced to ashes, however due to the existence of engravings it would be faithfully rebuilt.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I had seen the fortress, I would return to the car passing through the Jewish quarter of Segovia, which includes the entire southern part of the cathedral. In it is the didactic center of the Jewish Quarter of Segovia. Leaving through the Postigo del Sol I will arrive at the Alhondiga where the Holy Week museum was located. In front of it is the municipal archive of Segovia. Continuing down the street are two of the best-known palaces in Segovia, the Cascales Palace and the Casa de los Picos. From there he would get to the car to continue the march to Valladolid.

					<p><strong>Valladolid</strong> is the most populous city and capital of Castilla y León. It is a city founded around the year 1000 AD. It has been the capital of Spain for 6 years in the reign of Felipe III, which will be when it has the most political importance in Spain. In addition, numerous palaces will arise in the city due to the transfer of part of the nobility that was in Toledo and Madrid. From that period its importance with respect to León, a city with much more history over the years, will grow.
                    <br><br>
                    The first point from which to see Valladolid was the Palacio de Santa Cruz. This palace was ordered to be built by Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza in the 15th century. It is Renaissance in style and was designed to be a higher education college. It is currently the seat of the university rectorate. Its façade has noble coats of arms that reveal the founders, with the <em>Ave ​​María Gratia Plena</em> of the Dukes of the Infantado de Guadalajara, from which Pedro Mendoza is a descendant. The courtyard is in the Renaissance style, one of the first in all of Spain. It houses the rectory room where paintings of all the rectors appear since the 20th century, which is when he had that role. It also contains a chapel and a museum inside. The museum has one of the largest collections in Spain on the kingdom of Oku (Cameroon), distributed in three different rooms. An exhibition of Terracotta warriors of the 20th century, one of trade goods and one of ancient clothing and documents. Very close to the palace is the headquarters of the university under a building with a very ornate baroque façade.
                    <br><br>
                    After seeing this palace I would continue to visit the center, the old cathedral. This cathedral, which was free when you visited it, is one of the poorest of the Spanish cathedrals, however the dimensions are very large. It has very thick columns to support the roof that rises very high. The interior is very dark with hardly any side windows. It has several altarpieces and several chapels, some with somewhat elaborate bars. Due to problems with the architects and the budget for several centuries it was not finished, having styles from various eras. Previously there were Romanesque collegiate churches on its site. Nearby is the church of Santa María la Antigua, also nicknamed the old cathedral. Contrary to the new one, this one was finished and looked good five centuries ago, but due to abandonment it was declared in ruin and had to be rebuilt in a different way. Only the tower that was restored and the apse were saved. Continuing with the religious buildings, I would see the church of Las Angustias and San Martín, both with baroque altarpieces and an interior style from the last two centuries. And finally the church of San Pablo, part of the old convent of San Pablo, a jewel of the Spanish Renaissance, with a facade more of a palace than a church. Numerous details such as coats of arms or carvings of the apostles make up the image. Inside it has chapels with very ornate decoration where great nobles of Castile were installed. The ceiling is decorated with coats of arms and a very elaborate late Gothic style. The central altarpiece and many elements would be lost in various robberies of the temple during the French invasion and the confiscation of Mendizabal in the 19th century.
                    <br><br>
                    Nearby is the Palacio de Villena, which contains one of the best-known and most beautiful nativity scenes in Spain, in the Neapolitan style with figures that exceed 10 cm in height. Another outstanding palace is that of Pimentel, which bears the history of Felipe II in its tilework, who was born in that palace and would end up giving it a prominent role. His son would establish it as the capital of Spain. Another more important palace is the Royal Palace, which functions as the general captaincy of the Spanish Army. On this occasion, all the brotherhoods of Valladolid were represented as a Bethlehem by means of playmobil figurines.
                    <br><br>
                    Nearby is the Plaza Mayor of Valladolid with a 17th century layout reminiscent of the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, which was also erected in the time of Felipe III. Nearby is Plaza Zorrilla where the large building of the Cavalry academy is and Acera de Recoletos street where the best shops and restaurants in Valladolid are located. It is known as the golden mile and has some outstanding modernist buildings. I would take the opportunity to eat one of the best suckling lambs in the city in that area at the well-known Figon restaurant.
                    <br><br>
					In the afternoon, he would visit the National Sculpture Museum whose building is a 15th-century Renaissance jewel. It was erected as Colegio de San Gregorio and contains the coat of arms of Isabel La Católica. It is even older than the façade of the Santa Cruz Palace. Since 1933 it has functioned as a museum and not as a school. In it are the best sculptures from all over the Spanish territory, altarpieces from churches or convents ceded either by confiscation or because they were in deposits without exhibiting their works. Also roofs of palaces or churches and paintings.
                    <br>
                    After seeing this museum, I would head to <strong>Simancas</strong>, very close to Valladolid. This town is known because the Historical Archive of Valladolid is located there. This building, which has functioned as a prison or a deposit for coins or documents, is now a Historical Archive and can only be visited by researchers.
                    Other places of interest are the town's main square, the Gothic-style church of El Salvador and the great medieval bridge that crosses it with more than 20 arches.

					<p>The first town to visit would be <strong>Wamba</strong> which owes its name to the Visigoth knight who was appointed king in that place. It has a very old church whose origin possibly dates back to the Visigoth period. Later it would become Mozarabic, which the structure has. With the reconquest it would already be enlarged in a Romanesque style. It contains a bear house made up of thousands of skulls and was the burial place of Queen Urraca of Portugal around the year 1170.
                    <br><br>
                    From Wamba I would go to <strong>Torrelobatón</strong>, an old town with an imposing castle, with a very tall keep. It is worth visiting the church of Santa María, in its Gothic style, with highly valuable baroque altarpieces.
                    <br>
                    Going west, next to the A6 motorway, is <strong>Mota del Marques</strong>. A town that is in the process of consolidating itself as a tourist destination. With its church of great value recently restored, its other church in ruins that is in the process of being restored and what was once a fortress is also being shored up. It also has a palace with a lot of history, such as that of the Marquises of Ulloa, with a very large patio and long balconies.
                    <br>
                    After seeing these small towns we would go to <strong>Urueña</strong> where we would stop on the road to see the hermitage of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción.
                    This temple is Romanesque and one of the few in Spain with an ancient Romanesque style from Lombardy, Italy.
                    <br><br>
                    Once in the city, its careful wall surprises, which can be visited in almost its entirety. This town is also called the Villa del Libro, due to the number of libraries and events related to reading. Its church has nothing exceptional but it is a very visited town due to its medieval air and how well cared for its streets are, as well as its ethnological museum that contains tools and instruments of the time.
                    <br>
                    Then he would go to the town of <strong>La Espina</strong>, to enter the monastery of Santa Espina. Today this monastery is one of the most important agricultural schools in Castilla y León. The monastery was inherited by some nobles after their confiscation and would be created as a school for the people of the area, in addition to providing them with food. Once the first students grew up, the heiress would leave the land to the students, as well as homes. The guide who explained it to me was a former student and knew in detail the history of the Cistercian monastery. What is most striking is that both the cloister and the church were damaged by French troops in the war of independence. Only the altarpiece saved the Virgin from a series of alabaster figures of great value. That figure was taken to a nearby church that he would later visit. Inside the monastery you can see the chapel of the nobles which, due to its location and the details that are preserved, is very similar to another in the area such as Tordesillas.
                    <br><br>
                    After seeing the monastery, I would go to one of the churches with the most history, that of San Cipriano, in the Mozarabic style, recently restored, in which the Mudejar roof has been changed to give it a more original appearance and the nave has been enhanced.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, I would go to Tiedra, a town known for its lavender fields and its castle. It also has a couple of quite important churches such as San Miguel and El Salvador. Currently they are restoring the remains of San Pedro to give them value. But without a doubt the most important is the hermitage of Nuestra Señora de Tiedra with a Baroque dome and many details.

                <h1>Day 4, know the towns of the province of Valladolid, second part</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v09/mapa_viajes9_4_valladolid-pueblos2.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes9_4_valladolid-pueblos2"/><br>                
					<p>The next day I would travel to see the towns in the area where I was staying, west of Valladolid. The most important town is <strong>Medina de Rioseco</strong>. This town has several churches of great importance. Along with Olmedo, Tordesillas and Peñafiel, it is one of the most important towns in religious architecture. Of the old wall, only the door of San Sebastián remains. The most important churches are that of Santa Cruz, which stands next to the main street in one of the most important streets. That of Santiago Apostol, with a highly detailed Renaissance façade, and that of Santa María de Mediavilla, the most important with one of the most valuable chapels in the entire province, along with Tordesillas and Peñafiel. In the chapel where some of the most important nobles are buried, the final judgment is represented in its dome, with Jesus and many of the most important characters of Christianity.
                    <br>
                    The most important thing in Medina is the convent of San Francisco that has the city museum, and one of the most beautiful churches, with a magnificent baroque altarpiece and balconies with all kinds of decoration from which the monks or important people listened to mass. .
                    <br><br>
                    The next town is <strong>Valdenebro de Valles</strong>. It has a valuable church with a Baroque-style altarpiece and a Gothic-style floor plan. Only a few ruins remain of the castle.
                    <br>
                    Another nearby town is Villalba de los Alcores with a larger church than the previous town of the same style. The castle in this town is for private use.
                    <br><br>
                    The next town, <strong>Montealegre de Campos</strong> has a church of incredible value, with a Baroque altarpiece of great value, more than one church with the rank of co-cathedral or collegiate. The golden Gothic-style dome has carvings of the apostles that give the church a monumental appearance. The castle is quite large and has been restored inside. A medieval fortress that despite its size does not contain anything special. In addition, the town has another church such as Santa María de la Paz.
                    <br><br>
                    After these four towns, I went to Palencia where I would start with <strong>Ampudia</strong>. This medieval town is one of the prettiest in the region with a renowned castle. Not because of its size, but because of its network of turrets that give it a very curious appearance. In addition, inside it has palatial rooms since it served as the residence of different nobles. Close to the castle is the hermitage of Ampudia which was built at the same time as the castle.
                    <br>
					The most important part of the town apart from the castle is the collegiate church and the main street. The collegiate church has a chapel of great value. The chapel of San Ildefonso. The Collegiate Church of San Miguel and the Plaza Mayor or Museum of Sacred Art.
                    <br><br>
                    The main street is one of the oldest arcaded streets in Spain in which the original columns that are formed by pilasters or wooden trunks are still preserved.
                    <br><br>
                    Continuing through Palencia, it would reach Dueñas. This large town has a lot of heritage, the most important being the wall that is preserved, the church of Dueñas de Santa María de la Asunción, whose altarpiece is worthy of any cathedral. Some palatial houses around the church stand out, such as Napoleon's house. On the outskirts of the town, 6 kilometers away, I would approach the abbey of San Isidro. This Cistercian court abbey is used today by cloistered monks. You cannot access the interior but you can see it from the outside and enter the church.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, in the afternoon, I would pick up my friend from Valladolid to go to <strong>Olmedo</strong>, one of the most important towns in the province.
                    <br>
                    This town is also known for the play El Caballero de Olmedo, by Lope de Vega, the most important playwright of our era. There is a building, the Palace of Olmedo, where you can see a show with modern technology of the work. The price of admission in 2022 was around 4 euros, being together with the Mudejar miniature park that is on the outskirts the great claims of the city and that which contributes to giving money to the municipal coffers.
                    <br>
                    I did not deserve the entrance since the churches that close at 7:00 p.m. were closed to me. The church of Santa María del Castillo has a baroque altarpiece that is a jewel of religious art, as well as a large ancient reliquary. One of the largest and best preserved I have seen so far. Near this church are the other two in the town. That of San Andres, which cannot be accessed and can only be seen from the outside, and that of San Juan Bautista, embedded in the wall. This church is almost more important than that of Santa María, since it contains a chapel of great architectural value just behind the main altar, which is accessed by going down some stairs. This church has been recently restored and you can see the original paintings on the dome as frescoes. Other notable buildings are the convent of La Merced, which today functions as a municipal library. Also on the outskirts next to Parque Mudejar there is a spa that is one of the most famous in Castilla y León, where there is a four-star hotel. With this town the day of visits would conclude.

                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v09/mapa_viajes9_5_peñafiel.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes9_5_peñafiel"/><br><p>Empezaría visitando el pueblo de <strong>Castromonte</strong>, que tiene una iglesia de valor y una gran plaza Mayor. Había sido recientemente restaurada y aún quedaban partes de la plaza.
                    <br><br>
					Then I would approach the first important town, <strong>Rueda</strong>. This town is known for its wine tradition. In it there are many of the main wineries that produce wine with denomination of origin of Rueda, comparable in importance to Ribera de Duero.
                    <br>
                    The most notable building in the town is the church of Nuestra Señora de La Asunción. This church has a different structure than any church as it looks more like a fortress palace than a church. It has two towers that end in pinnacles and a baroque doorway more typical of a palace than a church. Inside, it stands out for the spaciousness of the nave, with several baroque altarpieces of great value. The walls are painted and plastered white and it shows how the towers have been added from the old Mudejar church. In the same street there are palatial buildings until reaching another of the important buildings such as the hermitage of Cristo de las Batallas, with a hexagonal floor plan.
                    <br><br>
                    Then I will go on to the route of the castles, in which we will change provinces, going on to Segovia. The next town will be <strong>Coca</strong> with a unique design within the Spanish castles. It is in the Mudejar style and has been modified over the years. Today there is a FP school inside and there are guided tours where I could walk along the outer walls as well as enter the interior of the towers. There are images of photos and engravings from recent times as well as its palatial patio completely made from scratch. This area was heavily damaged prior to restoration.
                    <br>
                    Other monuments that can be visited are the wall, which is being restored, the gate of the town and the tower of San Nicolas, one of the highest in the region. The church of the town, that of Santa María la Mayor is located in the Plaza Mayor of the town that is referenced to Theodosius, one of the Hispanic Roman emperors. He was born in this city, called Cauca in its Roman origin.
                    <br><br>
                    After Coca, he would go to visit <strong>Iscar</strong>. Iscar is a fairly large town but it does not particularly stand out in terms of heritage, but it does have a castle. The castle has been restored but is located far from the center on top of a hill.
                    <br><br>
                    Later, he would continue through Segovian lands to go to one of the most important and most historic towns in the province. Like the two previous towns, it has a castle. This castle is of superior importance both patrimonially and historically. This town is <strong>Cuellar</strong> and not only does it have a castle as in the case of Coca, but it also contains a unique architectural ensemble in the network of its streets in the historic center and its religious architecture. In addition, the wall and different doors and arches of the wall inside the town are well preserved.
                    <br><br>
					The entrance to the castle is not very expensive and is guided. This visit is carried out in the form of a play in which there is a story with different characterized characters that tell a story that happened in the castle. The castle was owned by the Dukes of Albuquerque. In the last century, the heirs ceded part of the building to the state to carry out an expensive restoration and save it from ruin, in exchange they kept some sectors of the castle. It also serves today as a secondary school.
                    <br>
                    Near the castle is the church of San Martín, which is currently owned by the town hall. Nearby is the old San Basilio hospital, which today is a restaurant and only the façade remains. If we continue around the castle we can visit the remains of the church of Santiago and its door in the wall. Nearby is the church of San Esteban and the necropolis of this church in which the excavations have been left in view with protection in some cases. The church of San Esteban is the most important and valuable church, in my opinion, in Cuellar. This church contains tombs of several of the nobles who ruled the city in medieval times. These tombs are topped with Arab plasterwork and Mudejar Gothic style like the rest of the church. In addition to this church in Cuellar is San Andres, which is larger and has the same Mudejar Gothic style that you would see at the end of the visit. After this church I would go towards the main square and the center, where the church of San Miguel and the town hall are located. This church has a very colorful and valuable baroque altarpiece. The most beautiful in the city from my point of view. The town hall, being Holy Week, was adorned with the flags of each of the brotherhoods that the city has. Near the town hall is the Trinidad convent which is now in private hands and where only the façade of the building can be seen. Also the remains of the church of Santa Marina and the palace of Don Pedro I which has one of the most valuable Mudejar coffered ceilings in Cuellar. To complete the visit, I would go to the church of Santa María de la Cuesta whose interior had just been restored this year. Nearby is the church of El Salvador with an original Mudejar tower and an almost complete apse that, due to the number of Mudejar churches, goes unnoticed. Another of the important churches is that of San Pedro, which is quite large and in the style of El Salvador. Finally, outside the town is the sanctuary of the Virgen del Henar. This sanctuary has a chapel adorned with a dome full of religious frescoes and a fairly sober baroque altarpiece.
                    <br><br>
                    After seeing Cuellar and following the route of the castles, I would head towards <strong>Peñafiel</strong>, to the north, one of the most important towns in the province. This town is known for its castle on top of the mountain closest to the town. I park away from the river at the convent of Santa Clara. I was lucky to be able to enter and see the convent church. In it there was a mini-museum of the steps of Holy Week. The floor plan is circular and its dome is baroque in style with a multitude of details. It is well worth entering. Once we have crossed the river, we enter the main square of the town with the church of Santa María de Mediavilla and the Sacred Museum where there are some altarpieces or remains of churches of great value. Pulling towards the church of San Miguel we can see several palatial houses, with different details referring to the city on their facade. The church of San Miguel is Gothic and inside the altarpieces are Baroque. Several of them have undergone a recent restoration and there are different panels that show you the before and after.
                    <br>
                    Near this church is the convent of San Pablo, which is the most important religious building in the city. In it is the chapel of the infante don Juan Manuel. Descendant of the Spanish royal family. In it there are up to 18 shields of different sizes and all kinds of details such as small angels that hold the shields. Also in a showcase are objects of this gentleman. Then he would go to the Coso de Peñafiel. This is the square where all the celebrations of the city take place and where the town hall is located. Called coso due to the absence of tiles or asphalt in it, since it is also used to celebrate bullfights or bullfights.
                    <br><br>
                    He would set course for Palencia where the rural house where he would sleep was located. Passing through <strong>Pesquera de Duero</strong> with a beautiful Plaza Mayor and an access arch to the town.
                    <br>
					Also through <strong>Encinas de Esgueva</strong>, a town with an Aguilar castle, built at the end of the 14th century, where Henry III would live at some point at the time when Burgos was the capital of the Kingdom of Castile. It also has the church of San Mames, which has a Baroque altarpiece of great value.
                    <br>
                    Finally, it would pass through <strong>Baltanas</strong>, a town renowned for housing the Cerrato Castellano museum where different exhibitions are held. In it is the Hospital de Santo Tomás palace, a symbol of the town. A palace with a Baroque façade with two large coats of arms and a very sumptuous courtyard. It also has the Gothic-style church of San Millan. With a very elaborate nave and the hermitage of the Virgen de Revilla. This hermitage has as a curiosity that it houses the figures of the first Bethlehem that is known in the Iberian Peninsula. Specifically two carvings belonging to the Flight into Egypt by Saint Joseph, the Virgin and the child Jesus. It was recovered from a robbery last century in which two other figures were lost and have not been found. Although I was no more than 1 hour, it is well worth spending an entire afternoon to see this beautiful town.
                    <br><br>
                    Very close would be my destination, Quintana del Puente where I would spend the night.

                <h1>Day, Palencia a Segovia pasando por Burgos</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid  rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v09/mapa_viajes9_6_palencia-este_segovia.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes9_6_palencia-este_segovia"/><br>    
					<p><strong>Quintana del Puente</strong> where I stayed, is a very quiet town close to the highway that connects Valladolid with Burgos. It has a medieval bridge and a Romanesque church. It also has numerous hiking trails since there is a lot of nature around.
                    <br><br>
                    Very close is the town of <strong>Palenzuela</strong>. This town is located in the old town of Pallentia that resisted the Romans. In times of the middle ages with the reconquest it would be of great importance due to its proximity to the Arlanza river and having a defensive position being on a mountain. A Romanesque hermitage would be built on the outskirts that exists today: the hermitage of the Virgen de Allende del Río. Nearby is the bridge and the entrance arch to the town. Within the city we have a couple of Gothic churches of great importance, that of Santa Eulalia, of which today only part of the outer walls remain, and that of San Juan Bautista, which houses the altarpiece of the other church. This church of San Juan is one of the most beautiful in all of Palencia, with a chapel with different tombs of noblemen of the city as well as other tombs on the other sides of the nave with all kinds of Gothic details. It has a very old altarpiece in the chapel with different paintings, and another wooden one from the other church that has been recently restored. We also found a very old Baptismal font and remains of carved stone with different carvings that belonged to the sacristy and that they are still thinking about what they are going to do with them since the sacristy is being restored. In it is the medieval tomb of a nobleman who could have royal descendants due to the shape of the tomb.
                    <br>
                    Outside the church are the ruins of the castle of Palenzuela. In its day it was a great castle but part of its stones would be collected to build the church and houses in the area.
                    <br><br>
                    The next point to visit would be the Cistercian monastery of Santa María la Real. On the way I would stop in <strong>Villahoz</strong> to see its Gothic church. Outside it has a door with a carved stone arch and inside a roof with Gothic arches and Renaissance and Baroque altarpieces.
                    <br>
                    Continuing would be <strong>Zael</strong>, another town with a well-cared-for Romanesque church that has recently had exterior lighting installed. And without further ado, you would reach <strong>Villamayor de Montes</strong>, where the monastery of Santa María la Real is located. This monastery is inhabited by nuns, who act as guides. The church of the monastery is usually open and the highlight apart from the façade is the cloister of the monastery in Romanesque style. It is a very sober style with double columns as in other monasteries in the area such as Silos, although the chapels are only plants without any great detail. This is also due to the Cistercian way of life, without luxuries.
                    <br>
                    Once I have seen the monastery, I would take a walk through the town, which has nothing remarkable. Even the village church cannot be compared to the village churches seen above.
                    <br><br>
                    The next town would be Covarrubias. This town is in the ranking of the most beautiful towns in Spain. Apart from the heritage it has, walking through its streets is very pleasant. It is a town with a medieval character in which almost all its houses have maintained their old appearance until today. It reminds me a lot of many German towns I visited last year made of old materials such as wood and adobe with the only difference being that in Germany the roofs are steeper and here they are flatter. The yellow color stands out in houses and restaurants. To enter the old town we must go through an arch that is over the building of the Archivo del Adelantamiento de Castilla, crowned by the shield of Felipe II, which would be the times when it would have more splendor. Although, its importance goes through times of the reconquest where several of the nobles who resided were adding importance due to the proximity to the kings. In fact, near this town a monastery would be built that would be one of the most important in the peninsula. Let us remember that Burgos was the capital for centuries until Toledo was reconquered and that little by little the latter would gain in importance.
                    <br>
					The most remarkable thing about the town is the main square, the tower of Fernandez Gonzalez, where today there is a museum of medieval siege machinery. And of course, the collegiate church of San Cosme and San Damian. The interior of the collegiate church is impeccable with a Gothic-style nave and many details of this style in the tombs of the nobles who rest there. The cloister can be visited and is done in a guided way, but you have to pay.
                    <br>
                    The church of the town is that of Santo Tomás. Like the collegiate church, it is Gothic in style, although it has undergone many reconstructions. The last one is that of the tower that burned down 100 years ago and that today is made of brick.
                    <br>
                    7 km from Covarrubias is the <strong>Arlanza monastery</strong>, a jewel from the 13th to 16th centuries. This monastery 1 century ago was completely in ruins and thanks to the intervention of the state and the Junta de Castilla y León it has been enabled to be visited without any risk. The monastery was very important after the birth of Castile, which came to house a large community of more than 100 monks inside. The proportions of the monastery are large, larger even than the Silos monastery that he would later visit. Nothing remains of the church except the apse and the plan of the columns, which were enormous, indicating the magnificence of the place. There are also some details of interior capitals. The tower and the exterior façade are perfectly preserved but a restoration has been necessary. Remember that because it is open to the outside without any wall or protection, it had a fortress structure. Not much more was needed since access to this place is difficult because it is delimited by mountains and the river and to enter it was necessary to come either from Covarrubias or from Salas de los Infantes. The jewels of the monastery were the entrance porch that was taken to the National Archaeological Museum to protect it, or the tomb of Mudarra that was taken to the Burgos Cathedral and today can be seen in the cathedral's cloister. Mythological pictorial images were also removed and taken to different museums around the world. Most are in the United States. This is all due to the abandonment by the clergy in the 17th century in favor of other monasteries and later to the confiscation of Mendizabal, which would already give it the final blow. After this time, being very little protected, the goods would be looted and damaged.
                    <br>
                    However, today, after the great remodeling work, you can walk inside and imagine what it was like centuries ago, although more panels and engravings would be needed to show how the different rooms were. In addition, this area became famous for different movies that were shot in the area. The most famous film would be the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, starring Clint Eastwood in 1966, in which the scene in which they fight in an abandoned canteen would be in this monastery and the final shot of the duel to 3 would be shot in an area south of the monastery, in which they would recreate an abandoned cemetery in the Western desert.
                    <br><br>
                    To get to the Silos monastery from the Arlanza monastery, you would go through
                    <strong>Salas de los Infantes</strong>, an old town that perfectly preserves its architecture and ancient history. The most noteworthy are its two Gothic-style churches, Santa María la Mayor and Santa Cecilia, and the Plaza Mayor, of which the town hall and the adjacent building remain. Nearby is a theme park dedicated to dinosaurs that has made this town appear on the map of towns to visit.
                    <br><br>
                    Continuing the trip, you would arrive at <strong>Santo Domingo de Silos</strong>, a town famous for the location of the monastery, which is one of the most important in Spanish geography. This monastery can boast of having the most careful Romanesque cloister, best preserved and best decorated in stone of all. The floor plan of the cloister is quite large with double pillar columns. Some of them with twisted or coiled columns that may be an innovation of the Romanesque of that time. Also in the corners they have different images of the life of Christ. The polychrome coffered ceiling is incredible with images of lions and heraldic shields or simply scenes from the countryside or agriculture. The day I went, his visit was free because it was Holy Thursday. I was also able to access the museum of the monastery where the monstrances are, a cross with gems, parts of altarpieces, polychrome carvings, paintings and some important elements from its time.
                    <br>
					The church of the monastery does not have much to say apart from its large dimensions, since it is stripped of altarpieces and paintings, counting only with the cross. The town's main square, where the town hall and some hotels and restaurants are located, maintains a homogeneity around the architecture of the monastery.
                    <br><br>
                    After Santo Domingo he would go to a town in Segovia where he would sleep. Go through Caleruega but don't stop. It is a town that is well worth a visit, being in the ranking of the most beautiful towns in Spain.
                    <br>
                    Due to how late it was getting, I would go to two more very close towns.
                    <br><br>
                    The first, <strong>Gumiel de Izán</strong>, very close to Aranda de Duero, which has a Gothic-style church that could well be a cathedral. It has a huge nave, which contains an altarpiece more typical of a cathedral than a church, with different carvings of the life of Jesus in various holes. In addition, the temple has a reliquary and chapels.
                    <br><br>
                    The other town, <strong>Vadocondes</strong>, whose church is not as sumptuous as that of Gumiel, has several details that make it unique. Like the stone spiral staircase in one piece. The 15th century processional float or some Romanesque carvings discovered not long ago inside its walls, which highlights the importance of the church more than 5 centuries ago. Outside it has a very nice Gothic-style Jurisdictional scroll and in front of it is the house of the Inquisition whose façade is still preserved. This town would have importance after converting the town to Villa under the mandate of Isabel La Católica. This is why the shield on the door or arch of the town that at that time had the natural protection of the limits of the Duero river and a great wall.
                    <br><br>
                    To finish, he would pass through Ayllon, which he would visit the next day and arrive at Grado de Pico, a town that borders Soria, Guadalajara and Segovia at the top of the mountain range.

                <h1>Day 7, get to know important towns in the east of Segovia and arrival in Guadalajara</h1>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded central_map " src="imags/viajes/españa/v09/mapa_viajes9_7_este_segovia-guadalajara.jpg" alt="mapa_viajes9_7_este_segovia-guadalajara"/><br>                 
					<p><strong>Grado de Pico</strong> is a Segovian town that borders the other two provinces, Soria and Guadalajara. You breathe nature and mountains, and freedom. The hotel in the town where I stayed is quite good, giving the feeling of being at home. Like the house of my town in the north of Guadalajara. The Romanesque-style church is very well maintained, with baroque altarpieces. It so happened that I ran into the village priest and also the mayor and they showed it to me. In general, the people of the town are very friendly and pleasant. This town is part of the so-called red towns of Segovia, in which the predominant material used for construction is ferruginous sandstone. These would be the type of town you would see in the morning, and there are also the yellow towns in which the material is quartzite and the black ones which is slate. The black towns are more typical of the province of Guadalajara on the other side of the sierra, with Majalrayo and Valverde de los Arroyos being the most famous examples.
                    <br>
                    After on the way to Ayllon, I would visit <strong>Santibañez de Ayllon</strong>, its streets and its church.
                    <br>
                    Finally, I would arrive at <strong>Ayllon</strong>, one of the most important towns in Segovia, which I would see during the day together with Sepulveda and Pedraza. This town has the honor of having the title of the most beautiful towns in Spain.
                    <br>
                    I would park near the church of San Juan, which is now private property, and from there I would go up to the castle ruins. From above you have a panoramic view of Ayllon, highlighting as buildings the Church of Santa María, the Plaza Mayor and the convent of La Concepción. In addition to these three sites that he would later visit, there are some palaces of great interest, such as the Flamboyant-style Contreras Palace with its stone cord bordering the nobility shields or the Bishop's Palace. It is worth seeing the arch of the town very close to these palaces. Arch or defensive door that had a double arch and in which any type of object could be thrown before an attempt to take the city. In addition to the church of Santa María la Mayor, which contains baroque altarpieces, there is the church of San Miguel, which may be the oldest in the town. A small temple with a chapel and some tombs of the nobles of the town. Nowadays, due to its location, in the Plaza Mayor next to the town hall, different exhibitions or markets are organized where typical local products are sold.
                    <br><br>
                    After Ayllon and on the way to Riaza, I would stop at Santa María de Riaza to see its beautiful Romanesque church, the Church of the Nativity. This church has a large plant full of Romanesque arches and inside a beautiful set of 3 altarpieces, one baroque and two older ones. The main altarpiece is adorned with a series of 18 Renaissance tables and the 12 apostles finish above, which may come from other religious buildings. The coffered ceiling is from five centuries ago, in the Mudejar style, although during restoration work pieces of the original Romanesque coffered ceiling have been found. These pieces of wood are exposed on the wall and give an idea of ​​the importance that the church could have had.
                    <br><br>
					Later I would arrive in Riaza, which, despite its good reputation, did not seem very monumental to me. It has a circular main square where the town hall is located and many restaurants and old houses of the time and a Romanesque church today completely restored inside. This church has an old chapel but it is quite sober.
                    <br><br>
                    After seeing Riaza, I would head to <strong>Sepúlveda</strong>, which I would say is the most monumental town in Segovia after the capital. The first thing I would do would be to park, which despite having set up a very large space, was full of cars. From there I would walk to the wall and the old gate of the Villa. The wall is preserved and the different stages of its construction can be seen by the shape of the rocks and the color. The most important church is that of Nuestra Señora de la Peña. It is Romanesque in style with a portico loaded with representations and some baroque altarpieces. In it is the carving of the Virgen de la Peña, which is the oldest part of the altarpiece. Pulling from there to the center you can see different noble houses such as the house of the Moor and palaces. The Plaza Mayor of the town impresses, with its old portals and its houses with balconies. It seems that the town hall was already built on the outskirts of the old city since the wall is just behind it. At the top of the town is the church of El Salvador, in Romanesque style with decorated capitals. Other important churches are San Bartolome and Justo y Pastor. Leaving the town, he would stop at the Zuloaga viewpoint where the Segovian painter would make some of his paintings about the towns of Segovia. There you can see the full extension and the limits of the town.
                    <br><br>
                    The next stop would be very close to Sepúlveda, although it should have stopped on the way out. Very close to the town of <strong>Duratón</strong>, a town of Roman origin where Confloenta is located, the site of the most important Roman town in the province after the capital. Just 3 km from the site is the church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, one of the most beautiful Romanesque churches in Segovia. The capitals stand out with plant, animal and nativity details of the Lord. On the outside supported on a series of arches with the mentioned capitals and decoration on the doors, archivolts.
                    <br><br>
                    The next town to visit would be <strong>Pedraza</strong>. It would stop very close to the old church of San Miguel, where the Imperial Eagle House is located. Then it would go up to the town where the first thing to find is the door of the town. Nearby is the town jail, one of the few medieval jails of the time, however the price of admission is not worth it and I would only go closer to see a little of the traces of the building. The most remarkable thing about the town are the views from above, the main square and its old houses around it, many of them with noble coats of arms. The church of San Juan Bautista is Romanesque in style and is very similar from the outside to other churches seen in Sepulveda. The castle is worth visiting and is done by a guide. King Francis of France was locked up in it 5 centuries ago and in recent years it would be bought by Zuloaga where he would set up his workshop and his heirs would set up the castle as a museum of his works.
                    <br><br>
                    Once Pedraza has been seen, it would stop at <strong>Pradena</strong>, where the famous Cueva de Enebralejos is located. This cave can be visited, however it is quite expensive to enter, so it is not suitable for all audiences. The town has nothing special, its church, its main square and its hermitage but due to these found caves it has been able to take advantage of the tourist vein.
